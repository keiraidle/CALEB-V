  Dear my lovely boyfriend Caleb,<br><br>
  I just wanted to say you mean so much to me.
  No amount of words could possibly explain how deeply I love you.   
  You make me laugh, you make me feel safe, and you make everything better.  
  Thank you for being you.

  I can’t wait to spend Valentine’s Day with you.

  Love,  
  Your girlfriend, Keira💌
